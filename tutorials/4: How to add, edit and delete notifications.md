#### You can specify the **languages **in which you want users to receive the notification. The message sent will be determined by the language they have set for the app. If the user's selected language is not available, the notification will default to English.

### On the Add Notification Schedule page, you will need to specify the following options:

1. **Notification Type**: Select from the notifications you have previously created.

2. **Calendar Event Type**: Choose between "Pregnancy" or "Vaccination."

3. **Offset Days**: Specify the number of days before the scheduled appointment when the notification should be sent. For example, if you set it to -2 days, the notification will be sent 2 days before the appointment.

4. **Time of Day**: Set the time at which the user will receive the message. This time will be synchronized with the user's time zone to ensure they receive the notification at the appropriate time.

### Once you have filled in these details, click "Save."
