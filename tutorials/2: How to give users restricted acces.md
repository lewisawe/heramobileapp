# 12: How to give users restricted access to admin panel

## **The admin panel:**

Our web based interface that contains the dashboard for site and user management

**User Management**

To manage users, navigate to the **Authentication and Authorization** tab. Within this section, you will find two primary categories: **Groups** and **Users**.

- **Groups**: Used to manage and organize users based on their roles and permissions. Groups simplify the process of assigning and updating access levels for multiple users simultaneously. \

- **Users**: Used to manage individual user accounts. This includes creating, editing, and deleting user profiles, as well as assigning users to specific groups. \

## Step 1 Click on the Groups Tab

The **Groups** tab provides a centralized view of all available permissions, such as adding, removing, changing, and modifying vaccines, immunizations, and other relevant data. By adhering to the principle of least privilege, you can assign the minimum necessary permissions to users, ensuring a secure and efficient management process.

### To create groups

Step 1:

- **Select Relevant Permissions**: Choose all the necessary permissions from the available options.
